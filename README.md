# NonogramSolver ![Build Status](https://github.com/soniro/NonogramSolver/workflows/Build%20%26%20Test/badge.svg)

:warning: **This is work in progress and will not solve nonograms yet.**

This simple application solves nonograms.

> Nonograms, also known as Picross, Griddlers, Pic-a-Pix, and various other names, are picture logic puzzles in which cells in a grid must be colored or left blank according to numbers at the side of the grid to reveal a hidden picture.

## Why do I implement this?

I know was already solved by other developers, but I always wanted to formalize the algorithm to solve nonograms and 
try to simplify it if possible as I really enjoy solving them. Additionally, I wanted to learn Kotlin.

## Contributing

I always planed this project as a personal pet project. So I don't expect any external contribution. However, if you 
have something to contribute (an idea for simplification or fixing flaws in the coding style etc.) feel free to send a 
pull request or contact me directly.
